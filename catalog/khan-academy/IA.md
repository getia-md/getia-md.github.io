# Information Architecture — Khan Academy

## 1. Overview

Khan Academy is a free, nonprofit education platform offering mastery-based learning across math, science, computing, humanities, and test prep. The IA is structured as a knowledge tree — subjects branch into units, units into lessons, lessons into individual exercises and videos. The mastery system tracks comprehension through spaced repetition and adaptive practice, while Khanmigo (AI tutor) provides personalized guidance. The platform serves learners from K-12 through adult education.
